# MotionMap - maps for RubyMotion!

Adding a bit more sizzles to the boring ol' hashes for RubyMotion.

## ATTA BOY!

This is most entirely lifted from the awesome Map from Ara T. Howard (https://github.com/ahoward/map).
Made some adaptations to make it work in the RubyMotion world, but all the heavy lifting is his.

Hence all credits and ATTA BOY! should go to Ara for some very nice work!

## Installation

```
gem install motion-map
```

## From the original author

  the awesome ruby container you've always wanted: a string/symbol indifferent
  ordered hash that works in all rubies

  maps are bitchin ordered hashes that are both ordered, string/symbol
  indifferent, and have all sorts of sweetness like recursive conversion, more
  robust implementation than HashWithIndifferentAccess, support for struct
  like (map.foo) access, and support for option/keyword access which avoids
  several nasty classes of errors in many ruby libraries

## Docs

See docs (https://github.com/ahoward/map)

NOTE: Struct and Options functionality was pulled out for this release.
